## Hi there! 👋

I'm an enthusiastic and passionate developer, always ready to dive headfirst into the world of code. These days, I'm spending my time juggling Node and a whole bunch of JavaScript frameworks, but my personal favorite is React. 🎉

Why React? Well, it's a bit like my morning coffee: it wakes me up, stimulates me, and sometimes makes me a little jittery when it decides to break unexpectedly. But hey, what would life be without a little suspense, right? 😅

I've also dabbled in WordPress, C# with .NET Core, and PHP. I absolutely love UI design, coming from a graphic production background, but I wanted to bring those UIs to life with interactive JavaScript. When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies, tinkering with gadgets, or trying to convince my friends that promises in JavaScript aren't the kind you can break.

Even though I use JavaScript, I code more often in TypeScript because I'm a bit of a typing fanatic. I'm a huge fan of collaboration, and many of the people and developers I admire push me to go further, learn more, and venture into unknown paths. Always up for a new challenge, I'm a real jack-of-all-trades, and I love exploring every nook and cranny of this vast digital universe. 🚀
